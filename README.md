# Better Microsoft Container

**Prevent Microsoft from tracking your visits to other websites**

This is a fork of [Microsoft Container](https://github.com/jschenke488/contain-microsoft), a fork of [Facebook Container](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook)

Better Microsoft Container is an add-on you can install on Firefox to prevent Microsoft from tracking your activity on other websites, so you can continue to use Microsoft while protecting your privacy.

**Note:** To learn more about Containers in general, see [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/containers).

## How does Better Microsoft Container work?

The Add-on keeps Microsoft in a separate Container to prevent it from following your activity on other websites. When you first install the add-on, it signs you out of Microsoft and deletes the cookies that Microsoft uses to track you on other websites. 

Every time you visit Microsoft, it will open in its own container, separate from other websites you visit.  You can login to Microsoft within its container.  When browsing outside the container, Microsoft won’t be able to easily collect your browsing data and connect it to your Microsoft identity.

## How do I enable Better Microsoft Container?

We’ve made it easy to take steps to protect your privacy so you can go on with your day.

1. [Install Better Microsoft Container](#). This will log you out of Microsoft and delete the cookies it’s been using to track you.
2. Open Microsoft and use it like you normally would.  Firefox will automatically switch to the Microsoft Container tab for you.
3. If you click on a link to a page outside of Microsoft or type in another website in the address bar, Firefox will load them outside of the Microsoft Container

## How does this affect Microsoft’s features?

Microsoft Containers prevents Microsoft from linking your activity on other websites to your Microsoft identity. Therefore, the following will not work:

### Logging in or creating accounts on other websites using Microsoft

Websites that allow you to create an account or log in using Microsoft will generally not work properly.

## Will this protect me from Microsoft completely?

This add-on does not prevent Microsoft from mishandling the data it already has or permitted others to obtain about you. Microsoft still will have access to everything that you do while you are on google.com or on any Microsoft app, including your Microsoft comments, photo uploads, likes, and any data you share with Microsoft connected apps, etc.  

Other ad networks may try to link your Microsoft activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this add-on, there are other things you can do to maximize your protection, including changing your Microsoft settings, using Private Browsing and Tracking Protection, blocking third-party cookies, and/or using [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ ) extension to further limit tracking.

## How do I use Containers for other websites?

Good news! Containers aren’t just for Microsoft. You can use Containers to prevent websites from linking your identities across the Web by installing [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).
